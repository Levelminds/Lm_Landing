# Environment Directory

This directory tracks environment-specific manifests for the LM Landing workspace. Each environment records its purpose, entry points, and notes so contributors can quickly understand the scope of active initiatives.

## Available Environments

| Environment | Slug | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Homepage Rebuild](homepage-rebuild/manifest.json) | `homepage-rebuild` | Initialized | Rebuild the public marketing homepage with refreshed content, layout, and assets. |

Add a new folder inside this directory for each environment. Include a `manifest.json` file with the environment metadata and optional Markdown notes that capture planning details, checklists, and decisions.
