# Lm_Landing

## Repository Setup

This project tracks the upstream GitHub repository as `origin`.

To ensure your local clone points at the canonical remote, run:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Levelminds/Lm_Landing.git
```

Verify the configuration with:

```bash
git remote -v
```
